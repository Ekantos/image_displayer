In this section, the authors conduct zero-shot transfer experiments using the SAM (Segment Anything Model) for various tasks that differ from the model's original training task. They evaluate SAM's performance on new datasets and tasks not seen during training, exploring scenarios like single foreground point prompts and progressing through tasks such as edge detection, object proposal generation, instance segmentation, and even segmenting objects from free-form text. These experiments demonstrate SAM's ability to generalize across diverse tasks through prompt engineering, marking a departure from its initial promptable segmentation training. The section concludes with an ablation study.

-The task involves segmenting an object from a single foreground point, which is challenging due to the potential ambiguity of one point referring to multiple objects. Automatic metrics can be unreliable due to ground truth masks often not covering all possible masks. A human study rates mask quality on a scale from 1 to 10. The evaluation involves comparing the SAM model's performance to a strong baseline method (RITM). SAM's ability to predict multiple masks is evaluated by selecting the most confident one. The study uses a diverse dataset of 23 images for evaluation. SAM outperforms RITM on 16 datasets in mIoU evaluation, and an "oracle" result considering ground truth comparisons shows SAM's superiority across all datasets. Human study results indicate that annotators consistently rate SAM's mask quality higher than RITM's. An ablated version of SAM with a single output mask performs lower but better than RITM. SAM's ratings fall within 7 to 9, suggesting it effectively segments valid masks from single points. Notably, SAM performs better in human study ratings for datasets where its automatic metrics are worse. Additional baselines (SimpleClick and FocalClick) and point sampling variations are also compared, showing SAM's strength in this task.

-The approach involves evaluating SAM's performance on the edge detection task using the BSDS500 dataset. A simplified mask generation pipeline is used, prompting SAM with a 16x16 grid of foreground points to produce 768 predicted masks (3 per point), with redundant masks removed using non-maximum suppression (NMS). Edge maps are generated by applying Sobel filtering to the unthresholded mask probability maps and applying lightweight postprocessing steps. Qualitatively, SAM produces reasonable edge maps despite not being specifically trained for edge detection. It predicts more edges compared to the ground truth, including sensible ones not annotated in BSDS500. Quantitatively, this bias is reflected in the recall at 50% precision (R50) metric, which is high at the expense of precision. SAM's performance is competitive with pioneering deep learning methods like HED, albeit lagging behind state-of-the-art methods that have learned the dataset's biases. Nevertheless, SAM performs significantly better than outdated zero-shot transfer methods.

-In this section of the approach, SAM's evaluation is conducted on the mid-level task of object proposal generation, which is crucial in object detection research. Object proposal generation is used as an intermediate step in pioneering systems. To achieve this, a slightly modified version of the automatic mask generation pipeline is employed, and the generated masks are treated as object proposals. The evaluation is done using the average recall (AR) metric on the LVIS v1 dataset, which is challenging due to its numerous categories. SAM's performance is compared against a strong baseline implemented as ViTDet-H detector with cascade Mask R-CNN (ViT-H), also referred to as the "Detector Masquerading as Proposal generator" (DMP) method. SAM is applied zero-shot, meaning it wasn't specifically trained for this task or had access to LVIS images or annotations.
The results, as shown in Table 4, indicate that while the DMP method performs the best overall, SAM performs remarkably well on several metrics. Notably, SAM outperforms ViTDet-H in various categories like medium and large objects, as well as rare and common objects. SAM's underperformance compared to ViTDet-H is observed mainly in small and frequent objects. An ablated version of SAM that is "ambiguity-unaware" performs significantly worse than the original SAM on all AR metrics.

-In this phase of the approach, SAM is employed as the segmentation component within an instance segmentation framework. The instance segmenter is constructed by using an object detector (ViTDet) to generate object bounding boxes, which are then used as prompts for SAM. This showcases the integration of SAM in a larger system.
Comparing the masks predicted by SAM and ViTDet on COCO and LVIS datasets, the mask average precision (mask AP) metric shows gaps where SAM's performance is reasonably close to ViTDet's, albeit still behind. While SAM's masks often exhibit crisper boundaries than ViTDet's, a human study is conducted to confirm this observation. The study involves annotators rating the quality of masks produced by both methods on a 1 to 10 scale. The results, shown in Fig. 11, consistently indicate that SAM outperforms ViTDet in the human study.
The discussion revolves around the mask AP gap on both datasets. It's suggested that ViTDet might learn specific biases from the datasets' masks, which often possess undesirable traits. SAM, being a zero-shot method, doesn't exploit these dataset-specific biases. For instance, on the COCO dataset, where mask quality might be lower, ViTDet learns certain biases that SAM doesn't utilize. Similarly, even on the higher quality LVIS dataset, SAM isn't trained to adapt to specific idiosyncrasies and biases present in the masks, while ViTDet benefits from them due to its training process.

-In the final part of the approach, a higher-level task is explored: segmenting objects from free-form text prompts. This experiment serves as a proof-of-concept for SAM's ability to process text inputs. While the same SAM model is utilized as in the previous experiments, its training procedure is adjusted to incorporate text awareness without requiring new text annotations. For this purpose, each manually collected mask with an area greater than 1002 is associated with a CLIP image embedding.During training, SAM is prompted with the extracted CLIP image embeddings as its initial interaction. The crucial insight is that CLIP's image embeddings are designed to align with its text embeddings. Consequently, even though training uses image embeddings, the text embeddings are used for inference. In practice, during inference, the input text is processed through CLIP's text encoder, and the resulting text embedding is provided as a prompt to SAM for generating segmentations. This text-aware approach enables SAM to generate segmentations based on textual prompts without the need for specific text annotations during training.
